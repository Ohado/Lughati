# Lughati
Lughati is an innovative educational software designed to enhance early reading and writing skills for Arabic-speaking children. The software employs an independent and adaptive learning process, where students are guided step by step, making the learning experience engaging and personalized. Built using the GDevelop game engine, Lughati combines educational methodologies with interactive game-like elements to create a fun, effective learning environment.

This project was created as a part of the MindCET Ignite program, a startup accelerator for educational technologies under CET - The Center for Educational Technology (known as מט"ח). The development process involved a diverse and multidisciplinary team: I served as the main developer and activities designer, while the team also included a skilled UI/UX designer, a speech therapist with expertise in language development, and teachers and students from the Bedouin town of Hura. This collaboration allowed us to gather valuable feedback and insights, ensuring that the app was culturally relevant and truly met the needs of its intended users.

The core technology behind the project is GDevelop, an open-source game engine that enabled us to quickly prototype and iterate on the learning activities. The software's design and interactions are tailored to support the unique linguistic features of the Arabic language, which is often challenging for young learners.

When tested, most children indicated making progress. Post-experience interviews with the students showed positive experiences. Statements such as "I finally understand Fatha" and "I'll now remember all 'ba' forms" highlighted the app's positive impact on learning. Teachers universally endorsed the app's content and noted the positive impact it had motivating the children to learn, yielding increased learning efficacy within compressed time frames.
